# CS-330-CompGraphic-Visualization

 # How do I approach designing software?
  To build a scene using OpenGL, understanding the objects to be created is essential, which involves visualizing the scene before its construction. The design process began by tackling the most difficult objects or those involving multiple components. The main code primarily comprises the indices and vertices of the shapes, while shaders, fragments, and other design elements can be utilized to create various designs in the future. 

 # How do I approach developing programs?
  The new development strategy was to use 3D graphs to plot points, as dealing with a 3D environment on a 2D screen makes it difficult to visualize where the points can go. The milestones helped prepare for the final project by using each milestone to build upon the prior one, aiding in better understanding and working towards the final project.

 # How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Problem-solving abilities, technical proficiency, and access to vast resources. It teaches you how to break down complex problems, automate tasks, and optimize processes, enabling you to work smarter and more efficiently. Additionally, computational graphics and visualizations provide new avenues for acquiring knowledge and skills that can be applied in both educational and professional pathways. These include data interpretation, critical thinking, communication skills, and problem-solving through design.
